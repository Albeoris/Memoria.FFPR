4. Close the game and edit the configuration file `$GameFolder$\BepInEx\config\Memoria.FFPR\$Section$.cfg`

## Troubleshooting:

- Share mod logs: $GameFolder$\BepInEx\LogOutput.log
- Create an issue.

## Export:

@Eatitup86:
Just providing these in case you want to use them. I posted this on a FF Modding Discord that has been collaborating a lot with the new pixel remasters. Will need updated just a bit if you resolve that Export always on issue. :)

1. Download BepInEx Loader + Mod from: https://github.com/Albeoris/Memoria.FFPR
2. Extract to the root of your game install.
3. Run your game + close it.
4. Navigate to InstallDir\BepInEx\config\Memoria.FFPR\ and open Assets.cfg
5. Set ExportEnabled = true
6. Run your game again, wait a bit for extraction to complete then close it.
7. Navigate to: InstallDir\FINAL FANTASY_Data\StreamingAssets\Assets\GameAssets\Serial\Data to explore the files within and make any modifications you would like to try.
8. Launch the game again and the changes will be applied automatically.
